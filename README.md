# Flight Delay Analysis
---
#### The what
This is a simple data exploration that was started for a college course, and will be expanded on as the topic interests me.

This datset contains flights from major carriers in the U.S from the year 2015.

To start I am looking to answer a few questions:
- Where are all the airports in this set?
- What carrier has the worst delays? (This could be its own exploration)
- What airports, regions have the worst delays, why?
- What airport has the most flights, delay ratio?
- Are longer routes worse for delays than short ones?
- What is the average overall delays and why?

I plan on adding a dashboard for some of the more interesting visualizations, and will continue to work on making it interactive.
