# Flight Delay Analysis
---
#### The what
This is a simple data exploration that was started for a college course, and will be expanded on as the topic interests me. This repositiory includes most of the work from the college course, and some expansion on it.

#### Current Analysis
- EDA of general delays over the year 2015
- Close look at top 10 busiest airports by flight amounts
- Airline flight and delay vizualizations
- Includes modified written report from the class
- Includes modified presentation from the class
- My first bigger project with R!

#### Future Additions
- Dashboard to allow users to explore airports, flight routes, and delays around the U.S.
