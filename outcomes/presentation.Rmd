## Quick About Me and Why This

- Hi, I'm Aden
- Interested heavily in Aviation, Space, this is my element
- I love database design and warehousing
- Our current commercial aviation is a logistic nightmare, often delays
- Seeing how a breakdown happens secondhand from SWA systems breaking

## Goals and Hopeful Outcomes

- I started this with some basic questions to get the ball rolling
- Understand what this set includes (3 Tables)
- Understand trends around the country for delay times and reasons
- What airports have the worst delays? What about on average?
- What are the most busy airports, how do they compare to the nation?

## One Last Thing
- I will throw around some abbreviation
- IATA (International Air Transportation Association) basically for trade on creation
though their codes are everywhere (PHX is an IATA code)
- FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) 
- I used FAA delay definition for most analysis, I will make it clear

## The Data
- Here we go, sourced my data from Kaggle, 3 tables (flights, airlines, airports)
- Airlines, basically holds names for IATA codes for airlines
- Airports, holds IATA codes (pk in this case), City, State, Country, Lat, Long
- Flights is the meat contains all our flight data, numbers, airline, origin, dest.
tail nums, schedules, alot of my edits, alot of data

## Summary
```{r, include=TRUE}
summary(flightsdf[,c("DEPARTURE_DELAY", "ARRIVAL_DELAY", "AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY",
                     "SECURITY_DELAY", "AIRLINE_DELAY", "LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY",
                     "WEATHER_DELAY")])
```

## Main Issues
- Lots of missing values
- Delays split up, good for some cases, but to start I go more general
- October has a huge issue not prevalent just yet...
- I won't realize how big this issue is until later
- All of October airports (org,dest.) are in FAA unique codes instead of IATA
```{r, include=TRUE}
count(flightsdf)
```

## Cleaning Time!
- For my use the all the delays that didn't happen being na is not good
\tiny
```{r, include=TRUE}
head(select(flightsdf, FLIGHT_NUMBER, AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY,
               AIRLINE_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY))
```

## Cleaning Time!
- Starting I make this monstrosity to set all my delay NAs to 0
```{r, include=TRUE}
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% filter(MONTH != 10)
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% 
  mutate(AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY = replace(AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY, is.na(AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY), 0)) %>%
  mutate(SECURITY_DELAY = replace(SECURITY_DELAY, is.na(SECURITY_DELAY), 0)) %>%
  mutate(AIRLINE_DELAY = replace(AIRLINE_DELAY, is.na(AIRLINE_DELAY), 0)) %>%
  mutate(LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY = replace(LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, is.na(LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY), 0)) %>%
  mutate(WEATHER_DELAY = replace(WEATHER_DELAY, is.na(WEATHER_DELAY), 0))
after = select(flightsdf, FLIGHT_NUMBER, AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY,
               AIRLINE_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY)
head(after)
```

## Continued
- I decided to drop any observations with NA departure/arrival time 
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% drop_na(DEPARTURE_TIME, ARRIVAL_TIME, ARRIVAL_DELAY)
airportsdf <- airportsdf %>% drop_na(LATITUDE, LONGITUDE)
#post initial clean count
count(flightsdf)
```
- With this I think I have a good baseline to start playing around
- Next I am going to join the tables for later use

## Relational Data
- As the diagram from earlier I want to join these tables for ease of use
```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% left_join(airportsdf, by = c("ORIGIN_AIRPORT" = "IATA_CODE"))
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% left_join(airportsdf, by = c("DESTINATION_AIRPORT" = "IATA_CODE"))
flightsdf <- flightsdf %>% left_join(airlinesdf, by = c("AIRLINE" = "IATA_CODE"))
```
- Join the airports df to flights df by both the origin and arrival
- Join the airlines df to flights df by the airline IATA codes that match up

## Overview
- First I wanted to look at what I am dealing with visually
- This focuses in on the mainland, there are airports from Guam, AK, etc.
```{r, include=TRUE, message= FALSE, results='hide'}
setwd('~/code/school/dat301/Project1/reports')
`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)

airportsdf_sf = st_as_sf(airportsdf, coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"), crs = 4269)

#loading in shape file
state_map = st_read("cb_2018_us_state_500k.shp")

#jus,t mainland U.S
state_map = filter(state_map, STATEFP %not_in%
                     c('15','72','02','60','66','69','78'))

#highlight ten airports in red
#ten_start <- filter(airportsdf_sf, IATA_CODE == c('ORD','DFW', 'DEN','IAH','ATL','LAX','LAS','MSP','PHX','SFO'))

tm_shape(state_map) + tm_fill() + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(airportsdf_sf) + tm_symbols(col = "blue", scale=0.5) +
  #tm_shape(ten_start) + tm_symbols(col = "red", scale=0.5) +
  tm_layout(title = "Airports in Mainland U.S.",
            title.position = c("right", "top"))

```

## Busiest Airports 
- You can see some of what I pointed out at a closer scale
- Decently distributed through the U.S, this set give a good feel for anaylsis
- What are the busiest airports now that we know what we are looking at?
```{r,include=TRUE, message="hide", warning=FALSE}
#for later
busy_airports = flightsdf %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>% 
  filter(DESTINATION_AIRPORT == c('ORD','DFW', 'DEN','IAH','ATL','LAX','LAS','MSP','PHX','SFO'))


top10_airports <- flightsdf %>% group_by(ORIGIN_AIRPORT) %>% 
  summarise(airport_count = n())
top10_airports <- merge(x = airportsdf, y = top10_airports, by.x = 'IATA_CODE',
                        by.y = 'ORIGIN_AIRPORT') %>%
  arrange(desc(airport_count))
total = sum(top10_airports$airport_count)
top10_airports <- slice_max(top10_airports, top10_airports$airport_count, n=10)

ggplot(data = top10_airports, aes(x = AIRPORT, y = airport_count)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +geom_col(aes(fill = AIRPORT)) +
  ggtitle("10 Busiest Airports by Flights") +
  xlab("Airport") + ylab("Flights") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Airport"))
```

## Delays
- Start generally, we are going to look at delay minutes, including below 15
- There's 5 causes in this set, lets look at how much each make up 
```{r, include=TRUE}
pie_time = c(sum(flightsdf$AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY), sum(flightsdf$SECURITY_DELAY), 
             sum(flightsdf$AIRLINE_DELAY), sum(flightsdf$LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY), 
             sum(flightsdf$WEATHER_DELAY))
pie_percent = round(100 * pie_time / sum(pie_time), 1)
pie(pie_time, labels = pie_percent, main = "Delay Causes", col = rainbow(length(pie_time)))
legend("topright", c("Air Sys", "Security", "Airline","Late Aircraft", "Weather"), fill = rainbow(length(pie_time)))
```

## Carrier Delays
- Total delay minutes by carrier
- Some of these are smaller airlines there will be an obvious descrepency
```{r, include=TRUE, results='hide'}
airline_total_delay = flightsdf %>% group_by(AIRLINE.y) %>% 
  filter(ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15) %>% summarize(total_delay_time = sum(ARRIVAL_DELAY))

ggplot(airline_total_delay, aes(x = AIRLINE.y, y = total_delay_time)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = AIRLINE.y)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Total Delay Minutes by Airline") + ylab("Delay Minutes") +
  xlab("Airline") 
```

## Carrier Delays
- A more interesting look is at carrier delay distributions
- These are split up by 5 minute chunks
```{r, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#delay minutes by airline
ggplot(data = flightsdf, aes(x = ARRIVAL_DELAY)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = AIRLINE), bins=60) + xlim(c(0,300)) + facet_wrap(~AIRLINE.y)
```       

## Airport Delay Amounts
```{r, include=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}

##Breaks??###
#flightsdf_delays = filter(flightsdf, ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15)
#delay_collapsed = gather(flightsdf_delays,'AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY','SECURITY_DELAY','AIRLINE_DELAY','LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY', 'WEATHER_DELAY', key = delay_type, value = delay_time)

#using FAA def of delay
faa_delay = filter(flightsdf, ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15)

airport_delays = faa_delay %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>%
  summarize(total_delays = sum(ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15))

airportsdf_sf <- left_join(airportsdf_sf, airport_delays, by = c("IATA_CODE" = "DESTINATION_AIRPORT"))
airport_cent = st_centroid(airportsdf_sf)

tm_shape(state_map) + tm_borders() + tm_shape(airport_cent) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "total_delays", 
             size = "total_delays", scale = 2,
             legend.size.show = F, alpha = 0.5, palette = "viridis")

```

## Airport Mean/Median Delay Minutes
```{r,include=TRUE}
#graphing total arrival delays for top 10 airports
flightsdf_delay1 <- filter(flightsdf, ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15)

airport_arrival_delay = flightsdf_delay1 %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>%
  summarize(arrival_delay_time_mean = mean(ARRIVAL_DELAY))

airport_arrival_delay_med = flightsdf_delay1 %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>%
  summarize(arrival_delay_time_med = median(ARRIVAL_DELAY))

cat("Mean", mean(airport_arrival_delay$arrival_delay_time_mean))
cat("Median", median(airport_arrival_delay_med$arrival_delay_time_med))

```

## Busy Airports Recalled
```{r, include=TRUE}
top10_airports <- flightsdf %>% group_by(ORIGIN_AIRPORT) %>% 
  summarise(airport_count = n())
top10_airports <- merge(x = airportsdf, y = top10_airports, by.x = 'IATA_CODE',
                        by.y = 'ORIGIN_AIRPORT') %>%
  arrange(desc(airport_count))
total = sum(top10_airports$airport_count)
top10_airports <- slice_max(top10_airports, top10_airports$airport_count, n=10)

ggplot(data = top10_airports, aes(x = AIRPORT, y = airport_count)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = AIRPORT)) + ggtitle("10 Busiest Airports by Flights") +
  xlab("Airport") + ylab("Flights") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Airport"))
```

## Busy Airports Mapped
```{r, include=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
delay_collapsed = gather(busy_airports, 'ARRIVAL_DELAY', 'AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY','SECURITY_DELAY','AIRLINE_DELAY','LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY', 'WEATHER_DELAY', key = delay_type, value = delay_time)

faa_delay = filter(delay_collapsed, delay_time >= 15)

airport_delays = faa_delay %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>%
  summarize(total_delays = sum(delay_time >= 15))

airportsdf_sf <- left_join(airportsdf_sf, airport_delays, by = c("IATA_CODE" = "DESTINATION_AIRPORT"))

#airportsdf_sf2<- drop_na()
airport_cent = st_centroid(airportsdf_sf)

tm_shape(state_map) + tm_borders() + tm_shape(airport_cent) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "total_delays.y", 
             size = "total_delays.y", scale = 2,
             legend.size.show = F, alpha = 0.5, palette = heat.colors(5))
```

## Busy Airports Delay Distribution
```{r, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
busy_airports = flightsdf %>% group_by(DESTINATION_AIRPORT) %>% 
  filter(DESTINATION_AIRPORT == c('ORD','DFW', 'DEN','IAH','ATL','LAX','LAS','MSP','PHX','SFO'))

ggplot(data = busy_airports, aes(x = ARRIVAL_DELAY)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = DESTINATION_AIRPORT), bins = 60) + xlim(c(0,300)) + facet_wrap(~DESTINATION_AIRPORT) + ggtitle("10 Busiest Delay Distribution") + xlab("Delay") + ylab("Amount")
```

## Continued
```{r, include=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
#flights by airline by month
ggplot(data = faa_delay, aes(x = MONTH, fill = AIRLINE)) + geom_bar(bins = 12) + facet_wrap(~DESTINATION_AIRPORT) + ggtitle("Flights by Airlines by Month") + xlab("Month") + ylab("Count")
```

## Arrival Delays by Month
```{r, include=TRUE}
#breaks down to have a row for type of delay, and the time in another
delay_collapsed = gather(busy_airports,'ARRIVAL_DELAY', 'AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY','SECURITY_DELAY','AIRLINE_DELAY','LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY', 'WEATHER_DELAY', key = delay_type, value = delay_time)

faa_delay <- filter(delay_collapsed, delay_time >= 15)

#delays by month by airport
ggplot(data = faa_delay, aes(x = MONTH, color = delay_type)) + geom_freqpoly(bins = 12) + facet_wrap(~DESTINATION_AIRPORT)
```

## Conclusions and Further Questions
- Hubs have high volume leaving room for most delays to occur from congestion
- Delays add up over time, not many large delays, though some airlines have more
- Delays increase in summer and holiday months
- Most delays are from something in our control in a way
- 40% of all flights from these airports
- ~80% of flights are on time, ~20% are delayed
- 36% of ALL delays are from the 10 busiest Airports
